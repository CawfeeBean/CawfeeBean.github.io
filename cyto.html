<h3>CITIZENS OF CELL CITY</h3><br>
      Our nucleus had its long reign over us, but it's time has come<br>
      It's too old and brittle and someone needs to take charge<br>


<br>
      <h4>THE CYTOPLASM IS HERE TO HELP<br>
        I, Mr. Cyto Pete Plasm, will keep Cell City in its prime</h4>
<br>
<br>
      </div>
      <br>
          
      
      <center><div style="height:650px;width:600px;border:2px solid #ccc;color:#99FFFF;font:18px/26px Georgia, Garamond, Serif;overflow:auto;">

      First and foremost, I should introduce myself to the citizens.<br>
      <h5>Who am I? What am I made of?</h5><br>
  I am a jelly-like substance that fills the cell.<br>
  I contain dissolved molecular building blocks and organelles.<br>
  I hold the floating DNA in prokaryotic cells so they don't fly away!<br>
  <br>
  The cytoskeleton is embedded within me and it's so important to every cell!<br>
        It's made of long fiber threads, composed of microtubes, intermediate filaments, and microfilaments.<br>
        Microtubes give the cell its shape and allows organelle movement and cell division by pulling the DNA apart.<br>
        Intermediate filaments give the cell strength.<br>
        Microfilaments enable cell movement and division, which is great for muscle cells.<br>
        <br>
        
        I also hold cytosol, which consists mostly of water, <b>THE SPICE OF LIFE.</b><br>
        <b>This is EXTREMELY important and necessary for cell structure</b><br>
        <br>
        <br>

       
    </div>
       
        <br>
        
        <center><div style="height:650px;width:600px;border:2px solid #ccc;color:#FF3366;font:19px/26px Georgia, Garamond, Serif;overflow:auto;">
        That was the personal spiel, but what about what the cytoplasm will do?<br>
          <b>WHY SHOULD YOU VOTE FOR THE CYTOPLASM?</b><br>
          <br>
          Simple!<br>
          1) We, the fibers and cytosol included, are people persons! We don't discriminate between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, we're just there!<br>
          2) We have a readily available water system! No one has to worry about dehydration!<br>
          3) Our transport system is the BEST! No worry about crazy traffic with organelles switching between lanes or dysfunctional stop lights. We got that covered!<br>
          4) We're very responsible. Based on previous experience in prokaryotic cells, due to the lack of membrane-bound organelles, we're able to work in many functions! Chemical reactions are alwaus occuring within us!<br>
          <br>
          <b>What would the cell be without us?</b><br>
          Without us, the cell will be significantly weaker and will fall apart.<br>
          It won't move, divide, or transport organelles.<br>
          It would be an apocalypse!<br>
          </div>
          <br>
          
           <center><div style="height:310px;width:600px;border:2px solid #ccc;color:white;font:16px/26px Georgia, Garamond, Serif;overflow:auto;">
          Please citizens, you must see that without me, the city will collapse.<br>
             What of the other candidates?<br>
             The cell membrane is biased against certain body types, only allowing small, nonpolar molecules into the cell. Rmemeber, we're a people person and accomodate for <b>every</b> citizen.<br>
             The chloroplast discriminates against prokaryote and animal cells, only cooperating with plant cells. <b>BIASED!!!</b><br>
             Vacuoles carry poisons sometimes, and what's that smell? They're like trash cans that collect toxic waste.<br>
             The smooth ER tolerates drugs, but decreases the effective of <b>USEFUL</b> drugs! What happened to our antibiotics???<br>
          Finally, until recently, the Golgi Apparatus was known to be static. Staying still won't solve anything!!<br>
             <br>
             Citizens, <b>be wise</b>. Vote for me!<br>
