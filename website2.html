<h2>What is tech?</h2>It's a field where you explore computers and new things.<br>It's another medium for art.<br>I don't know.<br>

What is tech for you?<br>

What is tech for you...?</textarea><br>
Whatever you say, it's valid<br>
Just as long as you say tech is not boring or scary<br>
<br>
Tech is not just about sitting in a cubicle, staring at a screen all day, and working in a gray, miserable environment<br>
There's color<br>
There's fun<br>
There's creativity<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>"But what about tech is creative??"</h3>Creative<br>
cre·a·tive<br>
/krēˈādiv/<br>
adjective<br>
<br>
1. relating to or involving the imagination or original ideas, especially in the production of an artistic work<br>
<br>
Yes, technology has its basic rules. However, aside from that, good hunting. Anything can be achieved with technology, as long as you have the idea, plan, and imagination<br>
Really, it's just like "Hey, get a computer, start up a program, and have fun from there. Got an idea? Do it."<br>
Here's a scenario<br>
<br>
Person A: I have an idea, but I don't know if I should commence it. After all, computer science is a professional, strict field. Do you think I should just throw away my idea?<br>
Person B:<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8g8lNOu.gif"><br>
Ideas are everything in computer science. That's how so many innovative products were made. Then, you got a plan that YOU get to strategize. Do whatever you want with that plan! Get creative!<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>What else can you do with tech?</h4> So many things!<br>
Digital art, graphic design, game development, fashion!<br>
There's so much you can do!<br>
<br>
To all those young children out there who believe tech is dull,<br>
Please reconsider<br>
There's a fun world out there in the tech world that you can pursue!<br>
